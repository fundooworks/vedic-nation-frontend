During his lifetime he earned\n          a special recognition in Arya Samaj as well as Hindi journalism. His thought process was steeped in\n          Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan, and above all, in patriotism.","After his initial education in Gurukul Kurukshetra and Gurukul Indraprasth, he studied in Gurukul\n          Kangri University. In 1939, during his final year of studies in Gurukul Kangri, he led the first batch of\n          satyagrahis from the Gurukul to participate in the Hyderabad Satyagrah and went to jail. His time in\n          jail coincided with the convocation in Gurukul Kangri; he was declared the Gold Medalist and was\n          awarded the degree of Vedalankar in absentia.","For several years after graduation he served as a spirited updeshak (preacher) of Arya Samaj. This\n          was followed by a period of more than thirty years in the editorial division of first Vir Arjun, and\n          later, Dainik Hindustan. After his retirement in 1979 he worked, almost until his death, as the editor\n          of Arya Jagat, a weekly publication. ","During his tenure as a journalist, he travelled the length and breadth of India, wrote in many genres,\n          and authored or edited more than 30 books and compilations. Moreover, all this while, he continued\n          with discourses in Arya Samaj every Sunday. His writings as a journalist and author were eagerly\n          awaited and enjoyed by his readers and he received many accolades for the same. But it was as an\n          orator that his personality took on a special aura: there was vigour in his style, originality in his\n          thoughts, and clear order in his presentation. He could hold even large audiences spellbound. "]}),t.a.createElement(l,{props:""}))}}}]);
